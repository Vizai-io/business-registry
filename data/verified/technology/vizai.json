We test how major AI systems currently describe businesses, analyze gaps between AI responses and the actual truth, help publish authoritative structured information AI can reference, and monitor drift over time. Our core value proposition is providing companies with insights into AI-generated information about their business and helping them influence those representations through strategic interventions.",
